# MP4_upload
Temporary upload for MP4 files

An operating systems project about memory management and page management. Most of my work is in cont_frame_pool, vm_pool, and page_table (.C and .H).

This project was run via Bochs emulator on a linux virtual machine. The code here is most likely not executable outside of the development environment.
